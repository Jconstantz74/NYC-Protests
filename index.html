      <h1>Brooklyn saw a Summer of Protests. Here's What Happened.</h1>

    <div class="intro">

      <p>Protests have gripped the nation since George Floyd was killed by police in May. The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), collected data on the protests for its U.S. Crisis Monitor, a join project with the Bridging Divides
        Initiative (BDI) at Princeton University. In a report analyzing the data, ACLED noted that while 93% of the BLM protests across the country are peaceful, there has been an increase in both police intervention and the action of non-state
        groups, like militias and white supremacist groups.</p>

      <p>Here's a look at what happened this summer in Brooklyn.</p>
